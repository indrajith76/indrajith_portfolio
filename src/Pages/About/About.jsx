          My favorite in this programming sector is to fix ‚Äçany Errors. Because
          in every error there is hope to learn something new. I won't quit
          until I can fix the error. In this programming life, I have tried to
          solve all kinds of problems and have succeeded. My policy is to stick
          with it until the problem is solved.
